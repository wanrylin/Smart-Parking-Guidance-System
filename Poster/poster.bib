	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to use the optimization modeling method to explore whether there is an ideal arrangement of course enrollments that can yield optimal parking demand and supply on college campuses. Design/methodology/approach Using the University of Louisville as a case study, this study deploys a three-step analytical process to examine the correlation between parking demand and course enrollment, estimate parking demand based on course enrollment with regression analyses and embed this estimated relationship in an optimization model that minimizes on-campus parking demand and supply. Findings The correlation analyses suggest significant correlations between course enrollments and on-campus parking. The correlation patterns are different between students and university employees. The optimization results indicate that coupling parking supply and course scheduling decisions can reduce parking supply by 30\%. Originality/value Voluminous studies on sustainable campus transportation have focused on transportation demand management strategies. The relationship between course-scheduling and parking demand was not explicitly accounted for in most studies. This study's results reveal that parking demand on campus depends on the number of courses offered across time. Thus, factoring and optimizing course schedules in campus parking decisions remains a viable and essential option to reduce on-campus parking demand.},

abstract = {We discuss the problem of predicting the number of available parking spaces in a parking lot. The parking lot is modeled by a continuous-time Markov chain, following Caliskan, Barthels, Scheuermann, and Mauve. The parking lot regularly communicates the number of occupied spaces, capacity, arrival and parking rate through a vehicular ad-hoc network. The navigation system in the vehicle has to compute from this data the probability of an available parking space upon arrival. We derive a structural result that considerably simplifies the computation of the transition probabilities in the navigation system of the vehicle.},
