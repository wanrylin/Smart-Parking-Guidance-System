# Project Requirement
The course project requires students to demonstrate an in-depth understanding of modeling and analysis tools learned from the course, and to apply the tools in solving practical problems. The project should take the form of a research paper, similar to those found in the published networking literature. (Of course, there is no requirement that your project be publishable!) <br>
